Idea behind this project:
I am a gym person. I like to workout 3 times a week.
I was facing one problem and that is access to workout plan. 

For me there were 2 options to get workout plan:
1. Search on Google : The problem with searching on google is that no article provides direct access to workout plan. They share a lot of unnecessary information which I don't need because I already know those information and a lot advertisementdue to which I used to get distracted.

2. Watch a youtube video: Every video used to provide explanatory video about the exercise/workout which I did not wanted just a gist of what workout I have to do thats it and also searching on youtube is like giving 10 min of time to get the workout plan.



Sooo, I came up with this idea.
As I and most people use WhatsApp for communication so they have already installed that application. So I thought to take leverage of WhatsApp and built a WhatsApp chatbot on it.
